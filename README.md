### *Problem:* 
* Healthcare insurance fraud leads to billions in losses annually.
* *Fraud Types*:
    * Billing for services not provided.
    * Inflated bills or duplicate claims
    * Flasified patient records
    * Unnecessary procedure or prescriptions.


### *Solution*:
* Build a system using anomaly detection (e.g., DBSCAN, Isolation Forest) and machine learning(e.g, XGB) to identify fraudulent claims and abnormal patterns.

### *Features*:
* Automatically flag suspicious activities for review.
* Minimize false positive to avoid unnecessary investigations.
* Visualize claim trends and deviations.
* Ensure compliance with data privacy laws.


### Identify Metrics:
* Accuracy, precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC_AUC Curve for the fraud detecion model.
